      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.

      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.

      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there are
      no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add tasks
      downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
